## Model Architecture

This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify ECG signals, leveraging its ability to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies in time-series data. The model architecture is designed to handle the nuances of ECG data, which includes features at various levels of abstraction.

**Key Components of the CNN Architecture**:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: 
These layers are responsible for feature extraction from the raw ECG signals. Each convolutional layer applies a series of filters (kernels) to the input data, producing a set of feature maps that highlight important signal characteristics. Multiple filters of different sizes are used to capture various patterns, such as peaks and troughs in ECG data, which can represent different cardiac events. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is typically applied after convolution to introduce non-linearity, which helps the network model complex patterns.

2. **Pooling Layers**:
Pooling layers, usually Max Pooling, are employed after convolutional layers to downsample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions while retaining the most significant features. This process not only reduces computational complexity but also makes the model more robust to small translations and distortions in the ECG signal. Stride and pool size parameters are configured to control the extent of dimensionality reduction, preserving critical information while minimizing redundant details.

3. **Dense Layers**:
These layers consolidate the features extracted by the convolutional layers, enabling the model to make classifications based on learned representations. The final dense layer is configured with a softmax activation function to produce probability distributions across the different ECG classes, facilitating multi-class classification. Intermediate dense layers can also be added to enhance the model’s capacity to learn intricate patterns, with each layer potentially utilizing activation functions like ReLU.

4. **Dropout**:
Dropout is introduced to combat overfitting by randomly deactivating a proportion of neurons during training. This forces the model to learn more robust and generalized features. Dropout rates are carefully selected; typical values range from 0.2 to 0.5, depending on the model's complexity and the size of the dataset.

## Results
**Accuracy**: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 15% on the test dataset.
**Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score were calculated, showing the model’s performance in distinguishing between classes.
**Visualizations**: Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations help to assess the model's performance in more detail.
